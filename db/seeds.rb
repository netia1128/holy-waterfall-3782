# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# spirit = Airline.create!(name: "Spirit Air")
# flight1 = spirit.flights.create!(number: 970, date: "June 27th, 2021", departure_city: "Denver", arrival_city: "Fort Lauderdale")
# flight2 = spirit.flights.create!(number: 355, date: "June 27th, 2021", departure_city: "Fort Lauderdale", arrival_city: "Denver")
